# 👋Hi, I'm Alwin Varghese

Embedded Systems Developer | Wireless Security Researcher | IoT Engineer

I build secure, production-oriented embedded systems with a strong focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), wireless communication, and real-world IoT architecture. My work combines low-level firmware development, system reliability, and security-driven design principles.

## About Me

I am focused on designing embedded systems that are secure, scalable, and resilient. My interests lie at the intersection of:

- Embedded firmware development  
- Bluetooth Low Energy architecture  
- Wireless security and signal analysis  
- IoT system design  
- Secure communication protocols  

I prioritize clean architecture, fault tolerance, and practical security implementation over theoretical design.
